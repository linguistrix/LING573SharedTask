\begin{abstract}
  This document contains the instructions for preparing a camera-ready
  manuscript for the proceedings of ACL-2014. The document itself
  conforms to its own specifications, and is therefore an example of
  what your manuscript should look like. These instructions should be
  used for both papers submitted for review and for final versions of
  accepted papers.  Authors are asked to conform to all the directions
  reported in this document.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The following instructions are directed to authors of papers submitted
to ACL-2014 or accepted for publication in its proceedings. All
authors are required to adhere to these specifications. Authors are
required to provide a Portable Document Format (PDF) version of their
papers\cite{book1}. \textbf{The proceedings are designed for printing on A4 paper.}


\section{System Overview}

Manuscripts must be in two-column format.  Exceptions to the
two-column format include the title, authors' names and complete
addresses, which must be centered at the top of the first page, and
any full-width figures or tables. {\bf Type single-spaced.}  Start all
pages directly under the top margin. See the guidelines later
regarding formatting the first page. Do not number the pages. \cite{bothale2001}
\section{Approach}

ACL 2014 innovates over earlier years in that we will attempt to
automatically convert your \LaTeX\ source files to machine-readable
XML with semantic markup. This will facilitate future research that
uses the ACL proceedings themselves as a corpus.

\section{Results}

It is also advised to supplement non-English characters and terms
with appropriate transliterations and/or translations
since not all readers understand all such characters and terms.
Inline transliteration or translation can be represented in
the order of: original-form transliteration ``translation''.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

Long papers may consist of up to 9 pages of content, plus two extra
pages for references. Short papers may consist of up to 5 pages of
content, plus two extra pages for references.  Papers that do not
conform to the specified length and formatting requirements may be
rejected without review.

\section*{Acknowledgments}

The acknowledgments should go immediately before the references.  Do
not number the acknowledgments section. Do not include this section
when submitting your paper for review.
