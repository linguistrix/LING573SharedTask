149.1 D3 NYT19981123.0452 Instead, the channel will try new, women-oriented comedy spins on old formats such as the game show ``I've Got a Secret,'' and it is looking into investing in foreign-made animated shows

149.2 D3 APW20000831.0042 Also noticeable is the scant information framing the confessions, other than brief descriptions of the legal outcome of the cases (Court TV said on-screen blurbs will be added to provide somewhat more background than was included in preview copies of the show). Viewers eager for context can stay tuned for a panel discussion hosted by Court TV anchor Catherine Crier after the debut episode or can travel to the network's Web site (http://www.courttv.com).

156.5 D3 NYT19990219.0303 At present, NASCAR races generate about $100 million in TV rights fees each year
156.5 D3 NYT19990227.0233 While NASCAR will not approach the NFL's $17.9 billion TV deal, it could, given its soaring ratings and popularity, land a network package worth $500 million-$750 million, about as much as ABC paid for the NHL rights
156.5 D3 NYT19981212.0022 Although the NFL recently signed an eight year, $18 billion contract for its TV rights, NASCAR rights fees are sketchy
156.5 D3 APW19990224.0164 There wasn't much interest back in 1978 in auto racing and NASCAR made a decision to loan the rights to the tracks,'' said Bray Cary, NASCAR's vice president of broadcasting
156.5 D3 NYT19991112.0004 To put NASCAR's new TV deal into an easy to understand context, it is tantamount to the NFL, at the urging of commissioner Pete Rozelle, agreeing in 1962 to sell its national TV rights as a single unit
156.5 D3 NYT19990219.0303 More than leverage, a packaged sale to a limited number of networks would make TV a real partner in growing the NASCAR business, increasing the marketing value of the sport and, therefore, the value of NASCAR's broadcast rights
156.5 D3 NYT19990711.0032 And while its TV ratings have yet to approach the numbers achieved by baseball and football, Winston Cup racing has enjoyed a steady increase in viewership over the last three years, prompting NASCAR officials in February to consolidate their television rights in the hopes of landing a lucrative TV package that some are speculating will fetch anywhere from $300-$500 million
156.5 D3 NYT19991111.0385 The Fox network, NBC, and cable channels TBS and FX will pay an estimated $400 million annually for the broadcast rights to NASCAR's Winston Cup and Busch Series races, beginning in the 2001 season
156.5 D3 NYT19981212.0022 Even if NASCAR's study concludes all parties would be financially better off by allowing it sole authority to sell the entire TV rights package, the sanctioning body still will have to convince racetrack owners to go along with it
156.5 D3 NYT19990225.0034 NASCAR officials intend to continue the current TV rights fee distribution formula of 65/25/10 as it pertains to tracks, competitors and the sanctioning body, respectively
156.5 D3 NYT19990622.0221 AND, IN SUMMATION, I'D LIKE TO SAY _ NASCAR, don't grow so big, don't be so consumed with making money that you forget how you got to be so rich and famous
156.5 D3 NYT19990327.0015 SMI and other NASCAR track owners will certainly benefit from a new national television contract that could boost overall TV revenue from $100 million to about $400 million annually
156.5 D3 NYT19991111.0369 France was the driving force behind the new TV deal, convincing the single-track owners in April that negotiating the rights for the entire NASCAR season would be more profitable than doing the bidding individually
156.5 D3 APW19990224.0164 Helton said that he has no plans to change NASCAR's current TV rights fee distribution formula
156.5 D3 APW19990224.0164 NASCAR races generate higher TV ratings than regular season events in every sport other than NFL
156.5 D3 APW19990224.0164 That is a long way from 1985, when NASCAR received just $3 million for the TV rights to 28 races
156.5 D3 APW19990224.0164 NASCAR announced on Wednesday that it will no longer allow race tracks to negotiate separate TV deals, returning to the setup it had until 1978 -- when it was in charge of the sport's television rights
156.5 D3 NYT19991112.0004 Previously, the TV rights to NASCAR Winston Cup races were sold individually by the tracks, which caused some inequities from race to race and splintered marketing
156.5 D3 NYT19990219.0303 But the sale of TV rights on an individual track basis, Cotter said, is ``the one area where NASCAR is back in the 1960s

175.3 D3 NYT20000412.0419 As about 100 demonstrators gathered outside the Miami Beach mansion, a stark contrast to the modest home where Elian has been staying since he was found floating at sea Thanksgiving Day, the much-anticipated meeting began around suppertime
175.3 D3 NYT20000412.0419 But in a battle that twists and turns daily, it was uncertain whether Elian would actually be leaving, whether his father would be arriving, or whether any resolution would be reached

175.3 D3 APW20000129.0144 At the time, Elian's father expressed outrage
175.3 D3 APW20000412.0046 Reno's possible return to her hometown -- where Cuban protesters have displayed signs depicting her with horns and blaming her for the Waco confrontation -- would come at a crucial time in the Elian case

175.4 D3 APW20000211.0277 Elian's father told the attorney general he was worried about how the constant media attention and constant visits by Cuban American politicians to Lazaro Gonalez's home were affecting his child

175.4 D3 APW20000414.0270 That video, evidently made after Elian's Miami relatives met with Attorney General Janet Reno Wednesday night and obtained by the Spanish-language network Univision, disturbed communist officials and Cuban citizens in general
175.4 D3 APW20000329.0209 In light of the attorney general's clearly articulated views on the matter of whether Elian Gonzalez should return home, as well as the reality that each passing day is another day lost between Juan Gonzalez and his son, the court can only hope that those on each side of this litigation place the interests of Elian Gonzalez above all others
175.4 D3 APW20000122.0172 WASHINGTON (AP) - Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers told Attorney General Janet Reno "how much they are suffering" over the 6-year-old's continued stay in the United States and appealed for help Saturday in reuniting the youngster with his father in Cuba

210.1 D3 NYT19990902.0300 But last week, after six years of insisting the government did nothing to start the blaze at Mount Carmel where cult leader David Koresh and about 80 of his followers, including 20 children, perished, Reno acknowledged that she was ``very troubled'' by new information she had received that pyrotechnic devices may have been used
210.1 D3 APW19990903.0211 Even so, she said Friday that she is looking outside the FBI and Justice Department to find ``the perfect person'' to head an inquiry into the government's 1993 standoff with the Branch Davidians

210.1 D3 NYT19990902.0300 The 51-day standoff was, in fact, already under way when Reno took office March 12, 1993, and she began getting briefings from the FBI on the matter that same day

213.5 D3 NYT19981217.0123 In Ephron's witty version (which she co-wrote with her sister Delia), Hanks and Ryan play battling bookstore owners who anonymously exchange soulful e-mail messages (bagels, butterflies and Jane Austen are among the topics). It turns out both Joe Fox (Hanks) and Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) live in the same Upper West Side neighborhood (glowingly rendered in such a way to make a native New Yorker either boast or laugh in derision). Kathleen runs a charming children's bookstore, A Shop Around the Corner (nice nod to Lubitsch), that's being threatened by the imminent opening of a Fox Books superstore

213.6 D3 NYT19981217.0122 No wonder, then, that Hanks (who has become the world's biggest movie star in the five years since ``Sleepless'' hit) and Ryan (who now hates being typecast in most people's minds as a comic cutie) went for the ``Mail'' despite their natural inclinations to avoid froth
