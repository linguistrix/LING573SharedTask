152.3 D2 NYT20000612.1246 For writing of this kind in ``Die Zauberfloete,'' so florid and so freakishly high, we must once more look to the part of the Queen of the Night, written for Josepha Hofer, Mozart's sister-in-law, who at the time of ``Der Stein'' was on maternity leave

175.1 D2 XIE20000422.0123 WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Elian Gonzalez, the six-year- old Cuban shipwreck survivor who has been in the United States, was taken away from his relatives' home in Miami early Saturday by U.S
175.1 D2 XIE20000615.0332 Elian, six years-old, survived last November the shipwreck of an illegal immigrant trafficking, in which his mother and step- father died, and was delivered in American city of Miami to distant relatives, who refused to give him back to his father
175.1 D2 APW20000206.0118 Elian was rescued Thanksgiving Day after clinging to an inner tube for two days following a shipwreck that killed his mother
175.1 D2 APW20000206.0118 said in issues of Time magazine that go on sale Monday that it was making a pitch to Elian's U.S
175.1 D2 XIE20000406.0291 Elian, who is currently under the custody of his great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, in Florida, was rescued on November 25 last year from a shipwreck after his mother and 11 others died when the boat capsized in the sea off Florida
175.1 D2 XIE20000629.0267 Elian's return constitutes a major victory to President Fidel Castro and the Cuban people who have time and again demonstrated to demand the return of the shipwreck survivor boy to his Caribbean homeland in Cuba, observers here say
175.1 D2 NYT20000511.0402 In fact, Marisleysis Gonzales, the 21-year-old Cuban-American who became the little shipwreck victim's substitute mother of sorts, was constantly photographed or interviewed

175.1 D2 XIE20000422.0123 A short time later, Elian was brought out of the home, put into a van and whisked away
175.1 D2 XIE20000422.0072 A short time later, Elian Gonzalez was brought out of the home by a woman agent, put into a van and whisked away
175.2 D2 APW20000509.0235 He was reunited with Elian on April 22 after federal agents raided the home of their Miami relatives, where the boy was staying
175.2 D2 XIE20000424.0007 Elian was rescued on November 25 of last year near a shipwreck in the Atlantic sea off Florida after his mother and 10 others were drowned when their immigrant smuggling boat capsized

175.2 D2 APW20000509.0235 Elian has been at the center of an international custody dispute since late November, when he was found floating off the coast of Florida lashed to an inner tube
175.2 D2 APW20000520.0080 After staying with Miami relatives for several months, Elian was reunited in April with his father, who wants to take his son back to the communist island
175.2 D2 APW20000520.0080 Castro called for a national campaign of mass rallies demanding Elian's return shortly after the boy was rescued from the waters off Florida in late November
175.2 D2 APW20000114.0219 Elisabeth Brotons, Elian's mother, was among 11 people who died when their boat sank off Florida's coast
175.2 D2 XIE20000420.0354 Elian was rescued on November 25 last year after his mother and other 10 people were drowned in the Atlantic off Florida when their boat capsized
175.2 D2 APW20000121.0179 A news conference was scheduled for Friday afternoon; it was not immediately clear how long they were staying in the U.S

175.3 D2 NYT20000412.0419 One change was clear: the Miami clan headed by great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez seemed for the first time to accept that Elian and his father would return to Cuba
175.3 D2 XIE20000330.0300 The circumstances that now surround Elian's life in Miami, including the decision to allow camera crews into Elian's bedroom, the decision to permit a network news program to film a two-day interview with Elian without the father's permission, and the decision just last night to parade Elian in front of demonstrators in the streets of Miami, make it clear that Elian's best interests lie with his father," Craig said
175.3 D2 APW20000330.0176 The circumstances that now surround Elian's life in Miami, including the decision to allow camera crews into Elian's bedroom, the decision to permit a network news program to film a two-day interview with Elian without the father's permission, and the decision just last night to parade Elian in front of demonstrators in the streets of Miami, make it clear that Elian's best interests lie with his father,'' Craig said
175.3 D2 APW20000416.0070 The Herald reported that the family had earlier rejected a CBS request to let a ''60 Minutes'' crew tape Elian talking to his father while CBS anchor Dan Rather was with the father
175.3 D2 APW20000330.0176 The boy's mother, who was divorced from Elian's father, was among 11 people who died when their boat sank during the journey from Cuba to the United States
175.3 D2 APW20000330.0176 It was the first time anyone has said the father was ready to come to the United States immediately and stay for the court fight
175.3 D2 APW20000119.0191 Last week, Attorney General Janet Reno lifted an INS deadline to return the boy to his father in order to give Elian's relatives in Miami time to challenge the INS decision in federal court
175.3 D2 APW20000119.0193 Last week, Attorney General Janet Reno lifted an INS deadline to return the boy to his father in order to give Elian's relatives in Miami time to challenge the INS decision in federal court
175.3 D2 APW20000416.0070 The invitation was apparently made to support the family's claim that no one is keeping Elian from speaking to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who flew from Havana to Washington last week demanding that he be reunited with his son
175.3 D2 APW20000416.0070 MIAMI (AP) -- Young Elian Gonzalez was seemingly reluctant when he took a telephone call from his father and fidgeted during the conversation, but then blew kisses into the telephone when ending the call, a newspaper reported Sunday

175.4 D2 APW19990506.0237 District Judge David Folsom was to hear arguments today over whether former Attorney General Dan Morales, a Democrat, fabricated contracts with attorney Marc Murr that led to $260 million in legal fees
175.4 D2 XIE20000210.0085 Soeharto as a president, who had the authority to issue government and presidential decrees, is suspected of misusing his authority as a means to collect money to finance the foundations he chaired, and for the benefit of his family and cronies...which directly and indirectly caused state losses," Darusman said weeks after he was appointed by president Abdurrahman Wahid to be attorney general in October 1999
175.4 D2 XIE20000210.0085 Last year, investigation into Soeharto had been ceased by then acting Attorney General Ismudjoko due to 'lack of evidences'. The move, however, triggered angry from many parties nationwide who believed that the 78-old man was responsible for rampant corruption in the country during his 32 years rule

175.5 D2 APW20000119.0340 The INS's top official initially ruled Elian should return to his father, and the agency rejected a second asylum petition filed last week on behalf of Elian by Lazaro Gonzalez
175.5 D2 APW20000119.0340 Eig said Lazaro Gonzalez was asking the court ``not to decide the issues in the case, not to take custody away from Elian's father, not to decide whether or not Elian should go back to Cuba, simply to compel the U.S

176.2 D2 NYT20000427.0267 Directed by Sofia Coppola (R, 97 minutes). Coppola's directorial debut, in a movie adapted from Jeffrey Eugenides' 1993 novel about the self-destruction of five sisters in a 1970s Michigan suburb, shows her to be a filmmaker with fine visual and emotional instincts, adept at matching the book's hypnotic, sensual black humor

176.2 D2 NYT20000427.0267 Directed by Eric Bibo Bergeron and Don Paul (PG, 89 minutes). This animated buddy movie aspires to the airiness of a Bob Hope-Bing Crosby road romp, but it's hopelessly bland even by those timid 1940s standards
176.2 D2 NYT20000525.0189 Directed by Ridley Scott (R, 150 minutes). This movie is the answer to a question no one bothered to ask: what would happen if someone decided to film the imminent extreme football league as if it were a Chanel commercial
