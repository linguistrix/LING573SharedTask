156.5 D2 NYT19990227.0233 While NASCAR will not approach the NFL's $17.9 billion TV deal, it could, given its soaring ratings and popularity, land a network package worth $500 million-$750 million, about as much as ABC paid for the NHL rights
156.5 D2 NYT19990219.0303 At present, NASCAR races generate about $100 million in TV rights fees each year
156.5 D2 NYT19981212.0022 Although the NFL recently signed an eight year, $18 billion contract for its TV rights, NASCAR rights fees are sketchy
156.5 D2 NYT19990219.0303 More than leverage, a packaged sale to a limited number of networks would make TV a real partner in growing the NASCAR business, increasing the marketing value of the sport and, therefore, the value of NASCAR's broadcast rights
156.5 D2 NYT19991112.0004 To put NASCAR's new TV deal into an easy to understand context, it is tantamount to the NFL, at the urging of commissioner Pete Rozelle, agreeing in 1962 to sell its national TV rights as a single unit

156.5 D2 NYT19990225.0034 NASCAR officials intend to continue the current TV rights fee distribution formula of 65/25/10 as it pertains to tracks, competitors and the sanctioning body, respectively
156.5 D2 NYT19981212.0022 Even if NASCAR's study concludes all parties would be financially better off by allowing it sole authority to sell the entire TV rights package, the sanctioning body still will have to convince racetrack owners to go along with it
156.5 D2 NYT19990227.0233 The move, announced Wednesday, will enable NASCAR, the only sport to see its TV ratings rise each year this decade, to command a hefty rights fee, more in line with the NFL, NBA, NHL, and Major League Baseball

172.5 D2 APW20000204.0258 In the face of a takeover bid by more traditional companies, some of Ben Jerry's socially responsible brethren don't want to lose what many of them consider their patron saint, the independent ice cream company that over the years carved out its place in the business world by being known as much for its social consciousness as the taste of its product
172.5 D2 APW20000118.0009 Besides that, a majority of the 206 Ben Jerry's franchise stores are encouraging customers to send postcards to the company's board members urging them to reject any takeover bid

190.4 D2 NYT19990217.0419 While the Weight Watchers classroom operation, which counsels customers on weight loss, increasingly had become profitable the last year, officials at Heinz said that it was not a vital fit in the food business
190.4 D2 NYT19990505.0503 The plan is for the ads to be shown worldwide as well, where Heinz hopes to get everyone to spend at least half as much on ketchup as Americans do, which is now about $2 a person each year
190.4 D2 NYT19990505.0503 He and other Heinz executives are expected to paint a bright picture of the company's future, particularly as it pertains to ketchup, at a food-industry conference organized by Goldman, Sachs Co
190.4 D2 APW19990908.0198 Heinz said sales of ketchup, sauces and condiments jumped 12.7 percent in the first quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago
190.4 D2 NYT19990722.0381 This year, Heinz began a new advertising campaign to bolster ketchup consumption and brand loyalty among younger consumers
190.4 D2 NYT19990217.0419 The company, which had sales of more than $9 billion last year, said the moves would amount to the ``greatest transformation in the history of Heinz,'' eventually generating savings of more than $200 million a year and earnings-per-share growth of 10 percent to 12 percent, not including the sale of Weight Watchers
190.4 D2 NYT19990217.0419 Now, Johnson and Heinz say they will bolster marketing and advertising costs, introduce new pricing initiatives _ including a 99-cent commemorative bottle of Heinz ketchup _ and introduce new packaging as a way to win back market share
190.4 D2 APW19990722.0063 That strategy consists of focusing on the products that made Heinz famous -- ketchup, Star Kist tuna, Ore-Ida frozen potatoes -- and acquisitions such as the recent purchase of ABC Indonesia, a leading maker of soy sauce and ketchup in the Far East
190.4 D2 APW19990722.0063 It was always a thorn in investors' sides, and the price paid was a good value for Heinz

190.5 D2 NYT19990505.0503 But with the stock near its 52-week low, analysts are taking a wait-and-see position as to whether Heinz's strategy _ which includes cutting some prices, distributing recipes in the manner of condensed-soup companies during the 1950s and trying to spin the image of ketchup to appeal to a wider audience _ will pay off
190.5 D2 NYT19990505.0503 He and other Heinz executives are expected to paint a bright picture of the company's future, particularly as it pertains to ketchup, at a food-industry conference organized by Goldman, Sachs Co
190.5 D2 APW20000402.0044 Heinz owns 54.6 percent of the ketchup market share on annual sales of $279.9 million, dwarfing its closest competitor, Hunt's, which has an 18.9 percent market share on sales of $95.3 million
190.5 D2 NYT19990722.0381 Now Heinz can get back to ketchup and its other mainstay food products
190.5 D2 APW19990615.0036 Heinz said it sold 11 percent more ketchup in the fourth quarter, 6 percent more seafood and had higher sales at its weight loss clinics
190.5 D2 APW19990217.0092 Smyth said the sale of the diet business will enable Heinz to focus on its six core food products: ketchup, relishes and other condiments; frozen foods like Ore-Ida potatoes, Bagel Bites and Weight Watchers; tuna; soups and pasta meals; baby foods; and pet foods like 9-Lives and Kibbles 'n Bits
190.5 D2 NYT19990217.0419 Heinz also will reorganize its global operations by doing away with affiliate units, such as Heinz Italy, in favor of organizing the company along six primary categories and six regions
190.5 D2 NYT19990217.0419 Now, Johnson and Heinz say they will bolster marketing and advertising costs, introduce new pricing initiatives _ including a 99-cent commemorative bottle of Heinz ketchup _ and introduce new packaging as a way to win back market share

196.6 D2 XIE19990212.0024 The report shows that the number of those who say they would vote "yes" to the euro in a referendum has jumped by seven points in the last month to 36 percent of voters
196.6 D2 XIE19990212.0024 However, a majority of UK voters remain euro-sceptic, with 52 percent still willing to vote against its adoption despite the euphoria which has surrounded its introduction
196.6 D2 APW20000121.0123 The Danish government is pro-euro, but Nyrup Rasmussen's main problem is his own voters: many Social Democrats are skeptical about tighter European cooperation
196.6 D2 APW20000121.0123 And Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has said the nation will face referendum on the euro before the next parliamentary elections, which will be held in the spring of 2002 at the latest

197.1 D2 NYT19990901.0442 AM has long been a leader in animal reproductive technologies, but the cloning of Chance _ the world's first of a bull _ is the Aggies' first from an adult cell
197.1 D2 XIE19990601.0311 The male mouse, nicknamed "Fibro", which is short for fibroblast, the type of cell from which he was derived, was cloned using tail-tip cells of adult male mice
197.1 D2 NYT19981208.0387 But with cloning, an adult cell would have to reverse its development somehow and become an early embryo cell, able to direct the development of an entirely new animal that was the identical twin of the adult that provided the original cell
197.1 D2 NYT19980722.0372 But those worries have been laid to rest by the mouse cloning report and also by two reports in Nature Biotechnology saying that DNA fingerprinting has conclusively shown that Dolly was born from a cloned adult mammary cell from a sheep
197.1 D2 NYT19980722.0372 The achievement, documented in a report in the current Nature magazine, is a long-awaited followup to the announcement more than a year ago of the birth of Dolly, the first mammal cloned from an adult cell, at the Roslin Institute in Scotland
197.1 D2 NYT19980723.0424 Yanagimachi and Wakayama took on the challenge just after scientists in Scotland announced last year that they had produced Dolly the sheep, the first animal to be cloned from an adult
197.1 D2 XIE19990601.0311 However, previously reported clones have all been produced using adult cells related to the female reproductive system, which raised the question of whether male mammals can be cloned in this way

197.2 D2 XIE19990601.0311 The birth of Fibro demonstrated that cloning using adult cells is not restricted to female or reproductive cells at all, said the researchers, Teruhiko Wakayama and Ryuzo Yanagimachi

201.6 D2 NYT19990313.0039 Bloom, too, notices the ways we reinvent Shakespeare when he attacks the academic attempt to usurp Shakespeare, the effort by critics he calls ``resenters'' to nullify, by moralizing and historicizing, the deeply human presence we feel in so many of Shakespeare's plays
