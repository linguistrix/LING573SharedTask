141.1 D3 NYT19980721.0034 A holdout for the first time in his 20-year career, the veteran football slinger is trying to make one thing perfectly clear: Someone should pay for Moon's Hall of Fame career
141.1 D3 NYT19980721.0034 All the confidence and ego it has taken to make him one of the best quarterbacks to play in the NFL, Moon should accept that the funky route of his NFL career is as much responsible for the position he is now in
141.1 D3 NYT19990212.0022 If this is to be the end of Moon's professional football career that started in 1978 in the Canadian Football League, he said he could become a broadcaster and even get involved in an ownership group for the next NFL expansion franchise in either Los Angeles or Houston
141.1 D3 NYT19980728.0017 Comparing Moon's career in pro football to what Ryan Leaf might do is like comparing apples and oranges
141.1 D3 NYT19990212.0022 The best thing I can say about Warren, and what's real, is at least I got a chance to play with him,'' said running back Ricky Watters, who admits Moon's presence was a big reason he signed with the Seahawks in free agency last year
141.1 D3 NYT19980721.0034 With such a contract upgrade as the one Moon and Steinberg are asking, it's more than clear that Moon is asking for the Seahawks to reward him as much for all his 20 years of pro service as he is asking the Hawks to pay him fair market value
141.1 D3 NYT19980731.0051 Despite a report that Moon said he will retire if the Seahawks do not increase their one-year, $2 million offer, club vice president Randy Mueller said Thursday it is up to Moon to either accept the deal or settle on another option _ such as continuing his holdout or ending his 20-year professional career
141.1 D3 APW19990213.0120 Recently released by the Seattle Seahawks, Moon said he has been contacted by seven NFL teams and there's a 60-70 per cent chance he'll play next season
141.1 D3 APW19990211.0250 AP) -- If Warren Moon wants to keep playing football, it won't be in Seattle
141.1 D3 NYT19980724.0004 Moon and Steinberg took ``taking care of you'' to mean a deal more in line with what the NFL's top quarterbacks are making
141.1 D3 NYT19980724.0004 _ Warren Moon says he is not trying to be difficult, but the veteran quarterback says he is having a difficult time understanding what he calls the Seahawks' ``stubborn'' stance in restructuring his contract
141.1 D3 NYT19981120.0080 His resume includes 15 NFL seasons, six years in the Canadian Football League and a Pro Bowl trip last season that provided leverage in his contract holdout during training camp
141.1 D3 NYT19981120.0080 To a growing cast of thirty-something NFL quarterbacks, Warren Moon is something of a father figure
141.1 D3 NYT19981124.0012 Erickson is hoping Kitna can do what Moon has been unable to: jump-start an offense that has slumped to 27th in the NFL
141.1 D3 NYT19981124.0012 Unlike Moon, who is in his 21st professional season, Kitna has played very little in his first three years in the NFL
141.1 D3 NYT19980721.0034 Thwarted by the NFL after playing at the University of Washington, Moon's career was forced to blossom in the Canadian Football League
141.1 D3 APW19990212.0052 Moon said Friday he has been contacted by seven NFL teams and there's a 60-70 per cent chance he'll play next season
141.1 D3 NYT19980731.0051 DALLAS _ Warren Moon can threaten to retire, but the veteran quarterback can't force the Seahawks to budge from their position on renegotiating his contract
141.1 D3 NYT19981203.0020 Maybe it is not such a great thing that with 21 years of professional experience, Moon's football IQ makes him a walking telestrator, ready to break down zone coverages at the drop of a hat
141.1 D3 NYT19981203.0020 Maybe all those years Moon spent learning to play coolly under pressure has muted the most critical ingredient for success as an NFL quarterback _ the ability to make plays
141.2 D3 NYT19980721.0034 Instead, Moon flew to Los Angeles, where he huddled with his agent, Leigh Steinberg, who has apparently convinced Moon that the Seahawks owe him a ton of career-ending cash
141.2 D3 NYT19980721.0034 When Moon signed his two-year deal with the Seahawks before the '97 season, he said Seattle was where he wanted to end his career, where he wanted his post-football life to flourish
141.2 D3 NYT19990212.0022 The best thing I can say about Warren, and what's real, is at least I got a chance to play with him,'' said running back Ricky Watters, who admits Moon's presence was a big reason he signed with the Seahawks in free agency last year

141.2 D3 NYT19990212.0021 At any rate, maybe the reason Moon was as bold as he was during his holdout was because he knew Erickson had leaned on him
141.2 D3 NYT19980720.0011 Moon was scheduled to make $550,000 in the second season of a two-year contract he signed last year, when Moon was expected to be the backup to John Friesz
141.2 D3 NYT19990212.0021 Moon was the backup, until he became the starter, even though Moon was better during training camp in the summer of '97
141.2 D3 NYT19980814.0040 I think Jon just wanted to take advantage of the work he was getting, and the work he was getting really paid off for him,'' Moon said
141.2 D3 NYT19980731.0051 Last week, Moon said he was not even thinking about retiring and Steinberg said it was ridiculous to consider retirement an option for Moon, who will be 42 in November
141.2 D3 NYT19990212.0022 Holmgren still thinks Moon can play and if this was a one-year deal, Moon probably would his choice to be the guy
141.2 D3 NYT19981124.0012 I was a little uncomfortable when Warren came and told me, just because I don't feel like he was the problem,'' Kitna said
141.2 D3 NYT19981120.0080 Physically, he is able to do those things and obviously the mental aspect, because of the years he's played, also helps him
141.2 D3 APW19990112.0330 Moon's agent said it was the first he and Moon had heard about it
141.2 D3 NYT19980731.0051 Despite a report that Moon said he will retire if the Seahawks do not increase their one-year, $2 million offer, club vice president Randy Mueller said Thursday it is up to Moon to either accept the deal or settle on another option _ such as continuing his holdout or ending his 20-year professional career
141.2 D3 NYT19980721.0034 _ The only problem with Warren Moon is that he is asking for the moon
141.2 D3 APW19990213.0120 Recently released by the Seattle Seahawks, Moon said he has been contacted by seven NFL teams and there's a 60-70 per cent chance he'll play next season
141.2 D3 APW19990218.0211 But no matter where Moon lands, he probably won't be a starter unless he signs on with the expansion Browns
141.2 D3 APW19990212.0052 Moon said Friday he has been contacted by seven NFL teams and there's a 60-70 per cent chance he'll play next season
141.2 D3 NYT19980814.0040 Kitna was more concerned Thursday because it was his fourth wedding anniversary and his wife, Jennifer, was in Bothell while he was in Cheney
141.2 D3 NYT19981008.0041 Even if Moon is able to start, the Seahawks have to be concerned about whether he can finish
141.3 D3 NYT19980731.0051 Last week, Moon said he was not even thinking about retiring and Steinberg said it was ridiculous to consider retirement an option for Moon, who will be 42 in November
141.3 D3 NYT19980720.0011 The club cites Moon's age (42 in November) and salary-cap restrictions for not offering Moon a longer deal or more money on a one-year contract
141.3 D3 NYT19981008.0041 Which is why the sight of Warren Moon walking gingerly after practice Wednesday was so disconcerting to the Seahawks
141.3 D3 NYT19990212.0022 If this is to be the end of Moon's professional football career that started in 1978 in the Canadian Football League, he said he could become a broadcaster and even get involved in an ownership group for the next NFL expansion franchise in either Los Angeles or Houston

156.5 D3 NYT19991111.0385 The $400 million annual rights fees will be worth four times the amount of this year's contract, when NASCAR's rights were sold by individual tracks and races were televised on six networks

From the crying pedal steel to Prine's slightly off-key Ernest Tubb vocals, these tunes could have been cut in a sweaty, smoke-filled recording studio 35 years ago
170.4 D3 NYT19991013.0270 In other words, John Prine's music may exist in a vacuum, but it was not born in one

170.4 D3 APW20000216.0100 I listen to John Prine sing and realize he has got a magical thing where he transfers his heart to his voice

170.4 D3 APW19980620.0874 I was going to ask John Fogerty to sing the song, but then I thought Steve Earle is like the perfect guy for it, just from having his own scrapes and struggles,'' Douglas said
170.4 D3 NYT19991013.0270 Prine also offers an interpretation of Hank Williams' ``Dear John (I Sent Your Saddle Home),'' and he and Iris DeMent had the nerve to revive Jones' duet with Melba Montgomery on ``Let's Invite Them Over,'' the only country hit to tackle a particular type of swinging: ``We're not in love with each other/ We're in love with our best friends/ So let's invite them over again

198.5 D3 APW19981125.0165 Adamov said the spent nuclear fuel from the Bushehr reactor will be sent to Russia for re-processing and then returned to Iran for re-use at the plant
198.5 D3 NYT20000605.0336 But Yeltsin would not relent, promising instead not to expand Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran beyond Bushehr, where as many as four reactor and turbine units are planned
198.5 D3 XIE19980312.0043 The report said it is not ruled out that in the future Russia and Iran will reach a new agreement on building two more energy units for the Bushehr nuclear power plant

198.5 D3 APW19981114.0386 MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's atomic energy minister will travel to Iran soon to check on plans for a nuclear power plant to be built there with Russian parts, a news report said Saturday

198.5 D3 APW19981125.0165 MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is studying the possibility of building three more nuclear reactors at a controversial power plant in Iran, Russia's nuclear power minister said Wednesday
198.5 D3 XIE19980312.0043 Russia's cooperation with Iran in the construction of a nuclear power plant met with strong opposition from the United States who blamed Russia for supplying Iran with know-how that can be used for military purposes, including for the creation of an Islamic nuclear bomb

198.6 D3 XIE19961014.0137 The country has made major progress in the development of nuclear power in its Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-95). In the first half of 1994, a 300,000-kw generating unit went into operation at the Qinshan power plant and two 900,000-kw units at the Daya facility
198.6 D3 NYT20000116.0121 Last March, Yevgeny Adamov, Russia's atomic energy industry minister, said Russia would continue its commercial nuclear cooperation with Iran, especially its program to help Iran complete two large reactors at Bushehr, one of which was damaged in the Iran-Iraq war
198.6 D3 APW19981125.0165 MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is studying the possibility of building three more nuclear reactors at a controversial power plant in Iran, Russia's nuclear power minister said Wednesday
198.6 D3 XIE19960104.0046 BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China is striving to bring its nuclear power capacity to 20 million kw by 2010 and plans to develop it mainly along its southeast coast from 1996-2000, said Jiang Xinxiong, president of the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), here today
198.6 D3 XIE19960104.0046 Projects will include the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant's second phase, the Ling'ao Nuclear Power Plant, and the Liaoning Nuclear Power Plant in the northeast during the Ninth Five-Year Plan, starting this year
198.6 D3 APW19981125.0165 The deal calls for Russia to complete its work on a dlrs 800 million contract to help build the Bushehr nuclear power plant and conduct a feasibility study for building the additional reactors at the same plant
198.6 D3 NYT20000605.0336 This is being done as compensation for Ukraine's decision to give up multimillion-dollar contracts to help Russia build a nuclear power plant in Iran, a project that is proceeding on Iran's Persian Gulf coast at Bushehr without Ukraine's participation
198.6 D3 XIE19960221.0118 Under the contract, Russia will help Iran complete the Bushehr nuclear power plant in southern Iran by supplying equipment and facilities as well as raw materials such as fuel for operation
198.6 D3 XIE19970723.0029 Moscow has been under pressure from Washington and Tel Aviv to stop helping Iran finish the nuclear power plant which will be the first nuclear power plant in the Persian Gulf
198.6 D3 XIE19970723.0029 and Israel have even threatened to stage a preemptive air raid against the nuclear power plant in the southern port city of Bushehr, alleging that Iran plans to build an atomic bomb
198.6 D3 NYT20000116.0121 But Russia, still brimming with stockpiles of nuclear fuel and weapons- related technology, has long sold sensitive nuclear and missile technology to Iran, and assisted Tehran's civilian atomic energy program over objections from Washington, which fears that Iran's domestic nuclear power program is being used to develop indigenous weapons
198.6 D3 APW19981125.0165 Adamov said the spent nuclear fuel from the Bushehr reactor will be sent to Russia for re-processing and then returned to Iran for re-use at the plant

198.6 D3 NYT20000605.0336 Just the idea that Iran wanted to generate electricity with nuclear power instead of using its abundant oil and gas resources was suspicious, and still is for many analysts
198.6 D3 NYT20000116.0121 Although it agreed this week to permit very limited international inspections of its nuclear facilities, Iraq, Iran's historic regional rival, has refused to permit inspections for more than a year
198.6 D3 NYT20000116.0121 But Iran has continued expanding its nuclear power sector even though it is among the world's largest oil producers
198.6 D3 NYT20000116.0121 The Clinton administration's concerns that Russia might be broadening its nuclear trade with Iran to include heavy water and graphite technology led the United States a year ago to impose sanctions against two Russian scientific institutions

213.1 D3 NYT19981218.0163 Where ``Sleepless in Seattle'' was about Ryan being attracted to Hanks after hearing him on a radio talk show, now we have Hanks and Ryan as two e-mail pen pals who don't know that they know each other in real life
213.1 D3 NYT19981217.0122 I think Tom spent a certain amount of `Sleepless' not sure if I knew what I was doing, and he was probably right about that
213.1 D3 NYT19981209.0049 ROMANCE IS BACK FOR TOM HANKS Tom Hanks talks about his new film, ``You've Got Mail,'' (a sparkling romantic comedy co-starring Meg Ryan,) how he managed his unlikely rise from the inane TV sitcom ``Bosom Buddies'' to his current success and why he thinks Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan'' struck such a chord in both veterans and younger Americans
213.1 D3 NYT19981218.0163 What she does not discover, however, is that Joe is the dream man she ``met'' anonymously in an on-line chat room, and she's been communicating with him daily
213.1 D3 NYT19981218.0163 This is an affectionate nod to the classic 1940 comedy by that name starring Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, and upon which this screenplay is based
213.1 D3 NYT19981218.0163 You've Got Mail'' has two absolutely beguiling stars in Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, a clever, straight-from-the-news premise, and New York's Upper West Side at Christmas time
213.1 D3 NYT19981217.0250 Cast: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey
213.1 D3 NYT19981217.0250 Ephron pays homage to that clever film here: it's the name of Kathleen Kelly's (Ryan) children's bookstore in Manhattan's Upper West Side
213.1 D3 NYT19981217.0250 The film is based on the play ``Parfumerie'' by Miklos Laszlo, which was made into ``The Shop Around the Corner,'' a 1940 comedy directed by Ernst Lubitsch and starring Margaret Sullavan and Jimmy Stewart, and into a 1949 musical ``In the Good Old Summertime,'' with Judy Garland and Van Johnson
213.2 D3 NYT19990324.0111 A thoughtful, sometimes slow-paced blood-will-tell parable, the movie's ostensible stars are Dennis Quaid as a guy who repairs vending machines in small Texas towns; Meg Ryan as a woman fleeing a bad marriage; and James Caan as Quaid's dad, a grifter with a vicious streak
213.2 D3 NYT19990113.0153 George Segal and Sandy Dennis are the young couple invited over for fun 'n' games (one is Get the Guests). The movie nabbed 13 Oscar nominations, including best actor and best actress for the stars (she won, he didn't). Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan How they met: While filming ``Innerspace,'' a comedy/fantasy/thriller directed by Joe Dante (``Gremlins''). Actually, they had hardly any scenes together

213.3 D3 APW20000223.0306 Among those invited were actors Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan, Diane Keaton and Whoopie Goldberg, several lawmakers and administration officials and Vice President Al Gore's daughter Karenna Gore Schiff, who studied in Spain, and her husband, Dr
213.3 D3 NYT20000216.0156 Here, Ryan discusses ``Hanging Up'' and its themes of ``responsibility overload,'' how she managed to simplify her life and why a solo commute can be a liberating experience
213.3 D3 NYT19981111.0464 Although she signed on without knowing who would play her husband, she admits the choice pleased her
213.3 D3 NYT19981218.0163 Although Ryan is in danger of wearing out her welcome as America's Sweetheart if she makes one more film in which she (A) gets the sniffles cutely, or (B) pads around in flannel jammies cutely, or (C) wrinkles up her nose more than 150 times
213.3 D3 NYT19981217.0122 She hasn't found those Hanks nudes on the Web either, and Ryan doesn't want to see what she knows has been posted on her
213.3 D3 NYT20000217.0353 The movie follows her plight as he becomes so mentally unstable that he finally has to be hospitalized and she has to struggle with the situation while fighting with her unsupportive husband (Adam Arkin) and trying to put together a big event at the Nixon Library
213.3 D3 NYT20000217.0171 She runs her own business, but she's such a mess it's amazing that she can even find time to shower, much less to keep her amazing house immaculate and her hair so perkily disheveled

213.3 D3 NYT20000218.0148 It showcases Meg Ryan at her ragamuffin best as the middle sister who gets stuck with most of the work of caring for an aging father in decline
213.3 D3 NYT19981218.0167 And as far as romantic comedies go, particularly the subset starring Meg Ryan, ``You've Got Mail'' is better than ``Sleepless in Seattle,'' not as good as ``When Harry Met Sally
213.3 D3 APW20000223.0306 The evening began on a slightly awkward note when the queen stumbled in her long black and gray gown as she scaled the North Portico steps to meet the Clintons
213.3 D3 NYT20000217.0353 If, on the other hand, you respond to her elfin charm (and I guess I do), this fourth and probably least inspired Ryan-Ephron collaboration (after ``When Harry Met Sally ... ,'' ``Sleepless in Seattle'' and ``You've Got Mail'') gets by, barely
213.3 D3 NYT20000217.0353 Your reaction to ``Hanging Up,'' the latest domestic comedy-drama from the pen of Nora Ephron, will depend largely on how much you like Meg Ryan

213.5 D3 NYT19990311.0081 Like the Meg Ryan character in the movie ``You've Got Mail,'' Wells and other independent sellers have increasingly felt the pinch of the behemoth bookstore chains and the unprecedented Amazon.com online juggernaut
213.5 D3 NYT19981217.0122 What I liked was that Nora's managed to make a movie that's romantic and you want them to get together and all that,'' Ryan adds, ``but she's also been able to observe what's happening in our culture right now
213.5 D3 NYT19981218.0167 But at its core, ``You've Got Mail'' is all about Meg Ryan, the reigning practitioner of Movie Star Cute
213.5 D3 NYT19981217.0123 But it's highly unlikely many will find fault with the movie's most celebrated institutions, its eminently likable stars Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan

213.5 D3 NYT19981217.0123 In Ephron's witty version (which she co-wrote with her sister Delia), Hanks and Ryan play battling bookstore owners who anonymously exchange soulful e-mail messages (bagels, butterflies and Jane Austen are among the topics). It turns out both Joe Fox (Hanks) and Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) live in the same Upper West Side neighborhood (glowingly rendered in such a way to make a native New Yorker either boast or laugh in derision). Kathleen runs a charming children's bookstore, A Shop Around the Corner (nice nod to Lubitsch), that's being threatened by the imminent opening of a Fox Books superstore

213.5 D3 NYT19981217.0122 It was harder for her last time, but I think she's found a way to make a movie satisfying on many different levels
213.5 D3 NYT19981221.0253 As ``You've Got Mail'' unfolds, and the arrogant prince of the city Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) gets his comeuppance _ from, of all people, the wincingly decent Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) _ you wonder if writer-director Nora Ephron is apologizing for the brittle, cool cruelty that she exhibited as a magazine essayist
213.5 D3 NYT19981218.0167 No, if you've ever been to a Meg Ryan movie, you know what happens

213.6 D3 APW20000629.0060 LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid have announced they are separating after nearly 10 years of marriage
213.6 D3 NYT20000217.0353 She spends the entire movie in a state of heightened exasperation, frequently lapsing into painful flashbacks, and constantly screaming into her cell phone at her two insensitive sisters, who are more than happy to let her carry the entire burden of their father's disintegration
213.6 D3 NYT19981217.0196 With those eyes and that smile, Ryan begins the movie in her typically adorable fashion, wearing socks with her flannel PJs
213.6 D3 NYT20000216.0156 There she'd be on the set of ``Hanging Up,'' the new comedy from writers Nora and Delia Ephron, and Kudrow would look at her out of the corner of her eye, watching and wondering just how Meg Ryan does what she does
213.6 D3 NYT20000217.0353 Based on a novel by Ephron's sister (and writing partner) Delia, it's the story of three sisters who have to deal with the incapacitation of their unpleasant and increasingly senile screenwriter father (Walter Matthau). The oldest is Georgia (Diane Keaton), a 50ish, self-centered magazine publisher; the middle sister is Eve (Ryan), a wife and mother in her 30s with her own party-planning business; and the youngest is Maddy (Lisa Kudrow), a shallow, Gen-X dilettante and soap-opera actor
213.6 D3 APW19980719.0875 The husband of Meg Ryan said his wife was first on the list
213.7 D3 NYT20000217.0353 Based on a novel by Ephron's sister (and writing partner) Delia, it's the story of three sisters who have to deal with the incapacitation of their unpleasant and increasingly senile screenwriter father (Walter Matthau).

213.7 D3 NYT20000217.0171 She runs her own business, but she's such a mess it's amazing that she can even find time to shower, much less to keep her amazing house immaculate and her hair so perkily disheveled
213.7 D3 NYT20000217.0186 It's clear that Eve Marks (Meg Ryan), a harried professional party planner, has reached the end of her rope when she arrives home one day to find a big shaggy dog munching on the telephone and doesn't have an instant conniption
213.7 D3 NYT20000216.0156 There she'd be on the set of ``Hanging Up,'' the new comedy from writers Nora and Delia Ephron, and Kudrow would look at her out of the corner of her eye, watching and wondering just how Meg Ryan does what she does
213.7 D3 NYT19981218.0163 Although Ryan is in danger of wearing out her welcome as America's Sweetheart if she makes one more film in which she (A) gets the sniffles cutely, or (B) pads around in flannel jammies cutely, or (C) wrinkles up her nose more than 150 times
213.7 D3 NYT20000216.0473 She has a young son and a nice but often away-on-business husband (Adam Arkin) and runs a high-end party-planning business
213.7 D3 NYT19981217.0250 In a movie as well-cast as ``You've Got Mail,'' which is the third screen pairing of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, peripheral noise is a detriment
213.7 D3 NYT20000217.0171 Ryan acts her heart out trying to make us like Eve, but she's straining against the increasing cloyingness of screenwriters Nora and Delia Ephron, whose own sibling rivalries had to be more realistic than what we see here
213.7 D3 NYT20000217.0353 She spends the entire movie in a state of heightened exasperation, frequently lapsing into painful flashbacks, and constantly screaming into her cell phone at her two insensitive sisters, who are more than happy to let her carry the entire burden of their father's disintegration
213.7 D3 NYT19981217.0214 Ryan threatens to go into overkill on cuteness, hopping around her apartment in her pajamas at the movie's beginning
213.7 D3 NYT19981217.0250 As she did in her 1993 hit ``Sleepless in Seattle'' and in the John Travolta comedy ``Michael,'' Ephron denies audiences any spontaneous emotional response to her movie's action
213.7 D3 NYT19981217.0122 Meg is very smart, she does not lie and she does not acquiesce to somebody's personality just to foment a conversation,'' says Hanks, who first worked with Ryan on the unsuccessful, 1990 whimsy ``Joe Versus the Volcano
213.7 D3 NYT19981217.0122 She hasn't found those Hanks nudes on the Web either, and Ryan doesn't want to see what she knows has been posted on her
213.7 D3 NYT20000217.0353 The movie follows her plight as he becomes so mentally unstable that he finally has to be hospitalized and she has to struggle with the situation while fighting with her unsupportive husband (Adam Arkin) and trying to put together a big event at the Nixon Library
213.7 D3 NYT20000216.0473 There are repeated flashbacks to earlier incidents involving trash-talking, sometimes mean-drunk, more often mildly misbehaving pops, all part of Eve's effort to figure out why she loves the old problem (though the film seems to think otherwise, we're left presuming she's just a wimp). When any configuration of sisters is on screen, it's usually for a shouting match or, if they're not in the mood for recrimination, one of those bonding movie food fights that no woman who cares the least about her clothes would ever enjoy
213.7 D3 NYT19981217.0196 With those eyes and that smile, Ryan begins the movie in her typically adorable fashion, wearing socks with her flannel PJs
213.7 D3 NYT19981218.0132 That's because Hanks's and Ryan's performances give the film such a core of undentable decency that they carry the film past this and a couple of other roadblocks, one being that he learns she's his mystery correspondent on the Internet before she learns he's her correspondent
213.7 D3 NYT20000218.0081 But Georgia's too busy to deal with it: She's on her cell phone with Vanity Fair scandal-monger Maureen Orth and planning the fifth anniversary of her self-titled magazine
213.7 D3 NYT19981218.0163 They inadvertently meet, and despite the fact that sparks fly, eventually she discovers that he is the guy bringing a store into her neighborhood that could force her out of business
